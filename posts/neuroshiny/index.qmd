<h2>Motivation</h2>

At the University of Edinburgh I was tasked with making a 3D stem cell model of the thalamus to aid in studying root causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders.

During my research I was constantly downloading, manipulating and making visualizations of different gene expression datasets in order to discover markers of the thalamus.

I thought to myself wouldn't it be useful if there was one website where I could easily select a gene of interest and see how it's expression changes in all these different datasets. I could see how it's expression changes in different species, time-points and different cell models (3D vs. 2D) and thus; <a class='hyperlink-dark' href="https://rosie-griffiths.shinyapps.io/NeuroShiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NeuroShiny</a> was created.
