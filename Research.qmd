<h2> My PhD </h2>

I completed my PhD in Stem Cell Research at the University of Manchester where we were interested in making cartilage from stem cells to treat osteoarthritis.

Here I undertook a <a class='hyperlink' href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61734-4"> study</a> using large RNA-seq datasets we aimed to elucidate mechanisms at which stem cells become cartilage.
