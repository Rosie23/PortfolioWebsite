<h2> My PhD </h2>

I completed my PhD in Stem Cell Research at the University of Manchester where we were interested in making cartilage from stem cells to treat osteoarthritis.

Here I undertook a <a class='hyperlink' href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-61734-4"> study</a> using large RNA-seq datasets we aimed to elucidate mechanisms at which stem cells become cartilage.

<h2>  Post-doctoral Research Associate </h2>

After my PhD I took a position at the University of Edinburgh where I was tasked with making a stem cell model of the human thalamus to study the causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders.
