We hope by making a cheap accessible ease of use automated staining machine we could aid in cancer diagnostics in poorly funded labs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Properties of the DaiDipper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheap\n\n\n\nWe aimed to have a total cost <£100\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen-access\n\n\n\nAll code and instructions to build on yourself will be published\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessible\n\n\n\nAll components should be easily accessible\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEase of use\n\n\n\nNo expertise knowledge required\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponents\n\nThe first version of the DaiDipper was built using Arduino.

    "text": "Motivation\n\nAt the University of Edinburgh I was tasked with making a 3D stem cell model of the thalamus to aid in studying root causes of Autism Spectrum Disorders.\nDuring my research I was constantly downloading, manipulating and making visualizations of different gene expression datasets in order to discover markers of the thalamus.\nI thought to myself wouldn’t it be useful if there was one website where I could easily select a gene of interest and see how it’s expression changes in all these different datasets. I could see how it’s expression changes in different species, time-points and different cell models (3D vs. 2D) and thus; NeuroShiny was created."
