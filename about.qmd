I'm passionate about science, big data, and innovative problem-solving. With a PhD in Stem Cell Research from the University of Manchester, I've transitioned into the world of data science, where I bridge the gap between research and technology.

Currently, I'm a Senior Data Solutions Engineer at Atorus Research, specializing in OpenVal and leveraging my expertise in R to develop powerful data-driven solutions. While R is my go-to language, I love exploring and learning new programming languages to expand my skill set.

Welcome to my space, where I share my work, insights, and projects at the intersection of data science and research! ðŸš€
